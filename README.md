PROJECT_NAME: CometApproachTrackingWebApp

## Description
The CometApproachTrackingWebApp is a web application designed to track and visualize the approach of the interstellar comet to Earth. It fetches data from reliable astronomical sources such as NASA's APIs, processes it, and displays the comet's trajectory, distance from Earth, and other relevant information in an interactive map. This project aims to provide an accessible platform for both amateur astronomers and the general public to stay informed about this rare celestial event.
